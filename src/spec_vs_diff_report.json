  "summary": "Frontend implements a branded minimalist post list with header and footer, and a warm earth-tone theme. Backend adds basic post creation and retrieval, but the backend data model, validation, ordering, and upgrade persistence required by REQ-1 are not implemented. Several unrequested features (delete endpoint, auth plumbing, extra footer attribution) were added.",

      "requirement": "Persistent BlogPost type with at least id, title, content, createdAt; create endpoint rejects empty title/content; list endpoint returns newest-first; posts survive canister upgrades via stable storage.",
      "reason": "Backend Post type lacks id and createdAt; create endpoint does not reject empty strings; getPosts returns map values without sorting; storage is an in-memory Map with no stable variables or preupgrade/postupgrade hooks, so it will not persist across upgrades.",
